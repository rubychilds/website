brief:
  Museum of Writing, wanted a brand refresh and website redesign. They want the logo to be modular, so adaptable for contexts and merchandise. <br><br>

  The logo is based on where one river joins another, being a conflux. Hence, the museum acts to join the writing community.  <br><br>

  Soft colours are used in the colour palette to represent the non-fictional and dream like worlds often created through writing.<br><br>
