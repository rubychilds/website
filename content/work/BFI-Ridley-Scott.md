brief: "BFI: Dystopia, is a fictional retrospective on Ridley Scott’s life, for the British Film institute. Scott is known for films such as Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982) and The Martian (2015), amongst many more. In his works, he is known for highly detailed industrial and urban environments often using hallways, vents and dark alleyways. His landscapes are often futuristic and he gets animators to sketch and design prior to any filming.  The stories themselves develop slowly to build tense climaxes.<br><br>
Through Scott’s cinematographic style, I designed the leaflet to be an accordion fold, imitating slowness shown in his films. The colour itself is highly contrasting to be futuristic and bold. I used orange, to represent the smoky lighting often found, similarly the blue is tinted with grey for this. The graphical elements and typographic lockup are both technical in nature, also representing his highly technical and detailed approach.
