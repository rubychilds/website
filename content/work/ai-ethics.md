brief: "Over the past year, I've had an increasing interest in AI and Ethics. Here I have written an essay on this topic. Limiting the word limit to 10k words, I found this essay very ambitious, and find it can easily become a book! I hope to return to some areas discussed here to discuss in more depth, as they deserve."
