brief: "PyData London is the largest Data Science group in the UK. PyData is the educational program of Numfocus, and is a global charity that aims to raise money to assist open source libraries. Here I ran meetups for 4 years and with the team we grew the community to 9k members. We focus on how Python is being used within Data Science. Along with running the meetup, I co-chaired the 2017 conference where I placed a lot of effort forming diversity initiatives which doubled the number of female attendees.<br><br>
During 2016 and 2017, I handled the branding of the conference, being my first ever design briefs. Both briefs have a focus on being London based, as PyData is a global.
