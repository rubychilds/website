              <h8>The Ghost of T.S.Eliot questions whether we should allow artists and people to live on after death. T.S.Eliot is himself, one of the profound poets whom has ever lived, producing works such as The Wasteland (1922), Four Quartets (1943) and The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock (1915), his most widely known work.<br><br>
              In this digital age we have a world filled of data, learning from every aspect of your life. We can now take data and feed algorithms to learn our choices and imitate them. Similarly, can we do this with words?<br><br>
              Here I fed a neural network, specifically a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), the collection of poems from T.S.Eliot. In turn the RNN was able to learn from this data, so that it can predict sequences of words. This meant once trained the algorithm can produce sentences based on that it has seen. Hence we question whether there is this aspect of ‘new’ works, that T.S.Eliot produces from beyond the grave.<br><br>

    <p class="poem">
        Seemed at play,<br>
        The tender moon was shining bright, the barge at molesey lay.<br>
        All in the balmy moonlight it lay rocking on the tide--<br>
        And growltiger was disposed to show his sentimental side.<br>
        His bucko mate, grumbuskin, long since had disappeared,<br>
        For to the bell at hampton he had gone to wet his beard;<br>
        And his bosun, tumblebrutus, he too had stol'n away-<br>
        In the yard behind the lion he was prowling for his prey.<br>
        In the forepeak of the vessel growltiger sate alone,<br>
        Concentrating his attention on the lady griddlebone.<br>
        And his raffish crew were sleeping in their barrels and their bunks--<br>
        As the siamese came creeping in their sampans and their junks.<br>
        Growltiger had no eye or ear for aught but griddlebone,<br>
        And the lady seemed enraptured by his manly baritone,<br>
        Disposed to relaxation, and awaiting no surprise--<br>
        But the moonlight shone reflected from a thousand bright stars<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

    <p  class="poem">
      Ed candle-flames,<br>
      Flung their smoke into the laquearia,<br>
      Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling.<br>
      Huge sea-wood fed with copper<br>
      Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone,<br>
      In which sad light a carved dolphin swam.<br>
      Above the antique mantel was displayed<br>
      As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene<br>
      The change of philomel, by the barbarous king<br>
      So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale<br>
      Filled all the desert with inviolable voice<br>
      And still she cried, and still the world pursues,<br>
      "jug jug" to dirty ears.<br>
      And other withered stumps of time<br>
      Were told upon the walls; staring forms<br>
      Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.<br>
      Footsteps shuffled on the stair.<br>
      Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair<br>
      Spread out in fiery points<br>
      Glowed into words, then would be savagely still.<br>
