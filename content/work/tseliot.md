              <h8>The Ghost of T.S.Eliot questions whether we should allow artists and people to live on after death. T.S.Eliot is himself, one of the profound poets whom has ever lived, producing works such as The Wasteland (1922), Four Quartets (1943) and The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock (1915), his most widely known work.<br><br>
              In this digital age we have a world filled of data, learning from every aspect of your life. We can now take data and feed algorithms to learn our choices and imitate them. Similarly, can we do this with words?<br><br>
              Here I fed a neural network, specifically a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), the collection of poems from T.S.Eliot. In turn the RNN was able to learn from this data, so that it can predict sequences of words. This meant once trained the algorithm can produce sentences based on that it has seen. Hence we question whether there is this aspect of ‘new’ works, that T.S.Eliot produces from beyond the grave.<br><br>
